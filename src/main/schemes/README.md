# Configuration of the Lightweight CMP RA
The **Lightweight CMP RA** behavior is specified in an configuration file. Path and name of this configuration file
is the first command line parameter needed to start the **Lightweight CMP RA**.
This configuration file is structured in many hierarchical entity sections holding attributes and sub entity sections.
The configuration file can be written in XML, YAML or JSON

So the structure coulds looks like

```xml
<toplevelentity attribute1="value 1" attribute2="Value2">
	<subentity1 attribute3="value 3" attribute4="Value4">
	... more nested entities
	</subentity1>
	<subentity2 attribute5="value5" attribute6="Value 6"/>
</toplevelentity>

```

or

```yaml
toplevelentity:
  attribute1: "value 1" 
  attribute2: Value2
    subentity1:
      attribute3: "value 3" 
      attribute4: Value4

# ... more nested entities

    subentity2:
      attribute5: value5
      attribute6: "Value 6"
```

or 

```json
"toplevelentity": {
   "attribute1" : "value 1",
   "attribute2" : "Value2",
	"subentity1" : {
	   "attribute3" : "value 3",
	   "attribute4" : "Value4",
	  
	  "___COMMENT___":  "more nested entities"
	  
	},
	"subentity2" : {
	   "attribute5" : "value5",
	   "attribute6" : "Value 6"
	}
}

```

The configuration file must contain **exactly one** [Configuration entity](#the-configuration-entity).
In a production environment the integrity of this configuration file must be protected by external measures.

Examples can be found in the [Test Configuration](/src/test/java/com/siemens/pki/lightweightcmpra/test/config).

## The Configuration entity

The **Configuration entity** and its sub entities describes the configuration and behavior of one **Lightweight CMP RA** instance.
It contains a sequence of **zero or more**
- [RaConfiguration entities](#the-raconfiguration-entity),
- [ServiceConfiguration entities](#the-serviceconfiguration-entity) and
- [RestHttpServer entities](#the-restservice-entity).

The **Configuration entity** has no attributes.

## The RaConfiguration entity

The **RaConfiguration entity** describes the configuration and behavior of one CMP (L)RA instance as specified in the [Lightweight CMP Profile](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-lamps-lightweight-cmp-profile/). A (L)RA instance receives certificate enrollment requests by its **Downstream** interface, forwards it to the **Upstream** interface and validates the enrolled certificate against the **EnrollmentCredentials**. The **EnrollmentCredentials** are also used to complete the certificate chain returned in the **extraCerts** of the enrollment response.

The **RaConfiguration entity** contains
- **one** [Upstream entity](#the-upstream-entity),
- **one** [EnrollmentCredentials entity](#the-enrollmentcredentials-entity) and 
- **one** [Downstream entity](#the-downstream-entity).

The **RaConfiguration entity** has no attributes.

## The Upstream entity
The **Upstream entity** describes configuration and behavior of the **Upstream** interface towards the CA. It contains
